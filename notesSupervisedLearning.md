What is Machine Learning -

Even among machine learning practitioners there isn't a well accepted definition of what is and what isn't machine learning. But let me show you a couple of examples of the ways that people have tried to define it. Here's the definition of what is machine learning does to Arthur Samuel. He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell defines machine learning by saying that, a well posed learning problem is defined as follows. He says, a computer program is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some task T, and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E.

I'm going to spend a lot of the time teaching you those sorts of best practices in machine learning and AI and how to get this stuff to work and how we do it, how the best people do it in Silicon Valley and around the world. I hope to make you one of the best people in knowing how to design and build serious machine learning and AI systems. 

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

Supervosed Learning

Regression problem = "predict a continuous value output"

classification problem

Support Vector Machine, a neat mathematical trick that will allow a computer to deal with an infinite number of features


in supervised learning, in every example in our data set, we are told what is the "correct answer" that we would have quite liked the algorithms have predicted on that example. Such as the price of the house, or whether a tumor is malignant or benign. We also talked about the regression problem. And by regression, that means that our goal is to predict a continuous valued output. And we talked about the classification problem, where the goal is to predict a discrete value output.
