What is Machine Learning -

Even among machine learning practitioners there isn't a well accepted definition of what is and what isn't machine learning. But let me show you a couple of examples of the ways that people have tried to define it. Here's the definition of what is machine learning does to Arthur Samuel. He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell defines machine learning by saying that, a well posed learning problem is defined as follows. He says, a computer program is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some task T, and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E.

I'm going to spend a lot of the time teaching you those sorts of best practices in machine learning and AI and how to get this stuff to work and how we do it, how the best people do it in Silicon Valley and around the world. I hope to make you one of the best people in knowing how to design and build serious machine learning and AI systems.
